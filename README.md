install_raspi-config
====================

Script to install raspi-config on Raspberry Pi devices with an Linux OS that's missing it. Like Kali Linux.
Must be run as root or with sudo.

sudo sh install.sh

The reference for the raspi-config package being installed might not be the latest one, since I don't update this script with each new version.
So use the installed raspi-config to update itself.
