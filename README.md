install_raspi-config
====================

Script to install `raspi-config` on Raspberry Pi devices with an Linux OS that's missing it. Like Kali Linux.
Must be run as `root` or with `sudo`.

```
git clone https://github.com/cryptomiles-dev/Install_raspi-config-Kali.git
cd Install_raspi-config-Kali
chmod +x install.sh
sudo sh install.sh
```
The reference for the raspi-config package being installed might not be the latest one, since I don't update this script with each new version.
**Use the installed `raspi-config` to update itself**
